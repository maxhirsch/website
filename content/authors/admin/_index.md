I am a sophomore math major at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu). 
I am broadly interested in Analysis, Machine Learning, and Statistics.
I am currently working with [Professor Jay Newby](https://newby-jay.github.io/) at the University of Alberta to estimate the probability hypothesis density (PHD) of the movement of particles in videos using convolutional neural networks and to infer parameters relating to particle motion from these videos.
I am Vice President of Projects for the [CMU Data Science Club](https://cmu-dsc.github.io) and a TA in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://cmu.edu/math). 
<!---In summer 2019, I interned at [Matrix Retail](https://matrixretail.com) where I implemented a new sales forecasting algorithm which sped up sales forecasting for 1000+ retail stores by 300% with accuracy comparable to that of the previous forecasting algorithm.--->
<!---In my free time, I work on [MLforAll](https://mlforall.xyz), an educational website dedicated to introducing people to machine learning by guiding them through model selection.--->
<!---I also maintain [FairTorch](https://github.com/maxhirsch/fair-ml), a Python library used for creating non-discriminatory deep learning models with PyTorch.--->
